Welcome to BIOST 509 -- Introduction to R for Data Analysis in the Health Sciences!

I am Prof. Amy Willis and I am the instructor for BIOST 509. I look forward to meeting you on Friday.

This course will introduce you to R for data analysis. The course covers loading, transforming, summarising and plotting data. We will discuss fitting regression models, but interpretation, model specification, inference and prediction are not covered in this class. If you would like to learn about modeling/inference/prediction, you may be better served by BIOST 508, BIOST 511 or BIOST 517. Information about these options can be found [here](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/courses/sequences).

The general structure for lecture time will be approximately 50 minutes of lecture, approximately 5 minutes for a break, then approximately 45 minutes of in-class exercises. The TAs and I will be present to help you with the exercises, and your answers to the exercises will be due via Canvas at the end of the lecture time. Please plan to bring a laptop to every class. You can check out a laptop for free from the UW Student Technology Loan Program [here](https://stlp.uw.edu/equipment/laptops).

To receive credit for the class, you will need to complete 7 out of 8 in-class exercises, and 7 out of 8 homeworks.

There will be no lecture on October 4 (Week 2).

I welcome students with diverse backgrounds and experiences, accessibility needs, and students requiring religious accommodations. Please reach out to me [adwillis@uw.edu](adwillis@uw.edu) to let me know how I can accommodate and include you in my class. More information will be available in the syllabus (posted later this week), and will be discussed on the first day of class.

Cheers,

Amy
